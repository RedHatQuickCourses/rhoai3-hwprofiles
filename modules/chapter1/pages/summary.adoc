= Course Conclusion: The Industrialized AI Platform
:navtitle: Course Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully navigated the transition from the "Wild West" of manual resource management to a governed, *Industrialized AI Platform*.

By implementing Hardware Profiles, you have replaced support tickets with self-service policy. You have moved from "hoarding" compute to "fair-share" scheduling. Most importantly, you have built a system that maximizes the Return on Investment (ROI) of your most expensive silicon.

== The "Industrialized" Architecture Recap

Let's review the complete architecture you have built:

1.  **The Physical Layer:** Your nodes are automatically labeled by the *Node Feature Discovery (NFD)* operator, exposing identifiers like `nvidia.com/gpu`.
2.  **The Governance Layer:** You created `HardwareProfile` Custom Resources (CRs) that define strict CPU/Memory limits and target specific hardware identifiers.
3.  **The Scheduling Layer:**
    * For *Fairness*, you integrated with *Kueue* to manage quotas and priorities.
    * For *Isolation*, you used *Taints and Tolerations* to pin specific workloads to dedicated hardware.
4.  **The User Layer:** Data scientists simply select a "T-Shirt Size" from a dropdown menu, oblivious to the complexity underneath.

== The Strategy Matrix: Your Decision Cheat Sheet

As you scale your platform, use this matrix to decide which configuration to apply to new hardware or teams.

|===
|Goal |Configuration Strategy |Implementation Detail

|*Maximize Usage*
|*Dynamic Queuing* (Kueue)
|Use the `LocalQueue` allocation strategy. Allows teams to "borrow" idle quota from others.

|*Strict Isolation*
|*Static Pinning*
|Use `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` in the profile. Apply `NoSchedule` taints to the physical nodes.

|*High Density (Dev)*
|*Time-Slicing*
|Configure the GPU Operator to advertise multiple replicas per GPU. Best for interactive notebooks.

|*Guaranteed Performance*
|*MIG (Multi-Instance GPU)*
|Configure A100/H100 GPUs into hardware-isolated partitions. Target the specific MIG identifier (e.g., `1g.5gb`) in the profile.

|*Project Security*
|*Scoped Profiles*
|Create the Hardware Profile CR in a specific user `Namespace` instead of the global application namespace.

== Your Final Checklist

Before you declare "Mission Accomplished," ensure your production environment meets these standards:

* [ ] **Discovery:** NFD is running and correctly labeling all accelerator nodes.
* [ ] **Definition:** Hardware Profiles are created with explicit `resourceLimits` to prevent starvation.
* [ ] **Automation:** Profiles using Kueue do *not* contain conflicting node selectors.
* [ ] **Visibility:** Profiles are correctly scoped (Global vs. Project) based on team access needs.

== Next Steps

You now possess the blueprint for a scalable AI infrastructure. Your next step is to **audit your current utilization**.

1.  Run a utilization report on your current GPU nodes.
2.  Identify "zombie" workloads that are reserving resources but not using them.
3.  Migrate those users to a "Fair Share" hardware profile today.

*Welcome to the era of Industrialized AI.*
